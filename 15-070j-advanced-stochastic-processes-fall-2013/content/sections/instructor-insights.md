Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _15.070J Advanced Stochastic Processes_ as it was taught by Professor David Gamarnik in Fall 2013.

15.070J is an advanced graduate level lecture-based course devoted to the theory of random processes.

Course Outcomes
---------------

### Course Goals for Students

*   Gain a deeper understanding of stochastic processes including martingale theory, filtration and stopping theorems, concentration inequalities, large deviations theory, Brownian motion, stochastic integration, Ito calculus, weak convergence and functional limit theorems.
*   Explore applications to finance theory, insurance, queueing and inventory models.
